      <h2 class="title">PhD Student Position in Environmental Soil Physics</h2>
      <p>A fully funded PhD position is available in the Environmental Soil Physics Lab at The Pennsylvania State University, led by Dr. Yingxue Yu, beginning in Fall 2026. Our research focuses on the fate, transport, and transformation of emerging contaminants through experimental, modeling, and field-based approaches. We aim to elucidate how physicochemical interactions and environmental conditions govern contaminant behavior across soil and water systems.</p>

      <h2>Specific Research Areas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transport of emerging contaminants (e.g., micro- and nanoplastics, PFAS, engineered nanomaterials, and pathogens) in saturated and unsaturated porous media;</li>
        <li>Aggregation, stability, and transformation of contaminants in aquatic and soil systems;</li>
        <li>Quantification of adsorption and interfacial interactions using QCM-D and related surface techniques;</li>
        <li>Characterization of soil hydraulic properties, water flow processes, and indicators of soil health;</li>
        <li>Uptake and interactions of contaminants with plants;</li>
        <li>Evaluation of the environmental sustainability and degradation behavior of biodegradable plastics.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Students have the flexibility to pursue research topics within these areas through laboratory, field, and modeling approaches using computational tools such as HYDRUS and R. The lab fosters a collaborative and supportive environment that encourages creative, rigorous, and independent inquiry into the environmental behavior of contaminants. Motivated students passionate about soil-water-plant interactions, contaminant transport, and environmental sustainability are welcome to join our growing team at Penn State.</p>
